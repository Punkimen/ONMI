            <p class="readed-text">ONMI has developed a scarcity-based economy where all valuable assets, such as
              tokens, resources and NFTs, have a limited supply.</p>

              Creating in-game clothing is a necessary step for players to level up their characters. If no one creates
              a certain item of clothing, it will not exist in the game.

            <p class="readed-text">As a result, players must use resources strategically to improve their characters and increase their
              chances of obtaining valuable materials, tokens, and models.</p>
