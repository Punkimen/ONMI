            <p>The main feature of onmi structural security is the separation of modules in the
              architecture of the
              technical implementation of the system.</p>
            <p>Each of the active elements within the overall interaction structure performs
              strictly its own function,
              while each
              module is a separate program with its own source code and its own personal security concept, which
              indirectly affects
              the overall security picture as a whole.</p>
            <p>This device is fully consistent with the philosophy of blockchain platforms.</p>

            <p>All computing processes integrated into the base of game mechanics are carried
              out in external
              environments, which allows not to overload the data storage system inside the blockchain platform. </p>
            <p>Additional computing power within the blockchain platform is not used, because
              each transaction relays to
              the block only
              the necessary information on the current state of the game in order to achieve maximum transparency of

      <p class="readed-text">ONMI is a living structure.<br/> We&#160;can only imagine what the future of ONMI will be,
        but we
        know for sure that AI technology will play its part: based on the patterns of user behavior, it will develop
        its scenario for the future.
      </p>
      <p class="readed-text">
        However, we believe that AI can never replace community - and even more so the lively emotions of
        communicating with like-minded people.
      </p>
      <p class="readed-text">
        Therefore, our priority is to develop ONMI's social features.
