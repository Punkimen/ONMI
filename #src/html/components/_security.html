            <p>Each active element in the overall structure performs its function strictly, and each module is an
              autonomous program with its own source code and personal security concept, indirectly affecting the
              overall security picture.</p>
            <p>A device like this is fully consistent with the philosophy of blockchain platforms.</p>

        <p class="readed-text"> ONMI is a living structure. We can only imagine what the future of ONMI will be, but we
          know for sure that AI
          technology will play its part: based on the patterns of user behavior, it will develop its scenario for the
          future.</p>
        <p class="readed-text">However, we believe that AI can never replace community - and even more so the lively
          emotions of communicating with
          like-minded people.</p>
        <p class="readed-text">Therefore, our priority is to develop ONMI's social features.</p>
        <p class="readed-text">In its philosophy, onmi is a nexus gen-app, in which the user's interaction with content
          and its author is
          rediscovered through story and gamification. Financial tools, chat rooms, marketplace - the inseparable link
          between
          the entertainment content and the service app that will be part of the new society.</p>
