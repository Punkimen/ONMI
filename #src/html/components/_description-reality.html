              By the middle of the century, 68% of the world's population will live in cities. The general obsession of
              technology companies towards fully immersive metaverses seems premature to us.<p>
                Our mission is to create a <span class="bordered-text">reality 2.0</span> layer over real cities, an
                AR-universe that will expand
                the boundaries
                of reality and make it more functional and impressive.</p>
